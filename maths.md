### Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem
##### 29-04-2020
From [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Arnold_representation_theorem) :

>_The Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem (or superposition theorem) states that every multivariate continuous function can be represented as a superposition of continuous functions of one variable. It solved a more constrained, yet more general form of Hilbert's thirteenth problem._
>
>_The works of Andrey Kolmogorov and Vladimir Arnold established that if f is a multivariate continuous function, then f can be written as a finite composition of continuous functions of a single variable and the binary operation of addition. More specifically,_

>_In a sense, they showed that the only true multivariate function is the sum, since every other function can be written using univariate functions and summing._

Professor Guiseppe Carleo mentioned in a [talk](https://youtu.be/90OZoet_1CU?t=639) that this can be said to be the first use of the concept behind neural networks, i.e. functions applied to linear combination of results of functions can be a very compact way of expressing any multivariate functon.

The above article quotes Shamit Kachru, a string theorist at Stanford University, 
> “Any time you hear about a striking result in number theory, there’s a high chance that it’s really a statement about modular forms.”

Read the answer by Bill Thurston. Also, the article that referred to the MathOverfow question.
