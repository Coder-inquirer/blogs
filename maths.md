### Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem
##### 29-04-2020
From [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Arnold_representation_theorem) :

>_The Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem (or superposition theorem) states that every multivariate continuous function can be represented as a superposition of continuous functions of one variable. It solved a more constrained, yet more general form of Hilbert's thirteenth problem._
>
>_The works of Andrey Kolmogorov and Vladimir Arnold established that if f is a multivariate continuous function, then f can be written as a finite composition of continuous functions of a single variable and the binary operation of addition. More specifically,_

>_In a sense, they showed that the only true multivariate function is the sum, since every other function can be written using univariate functions and summing._
